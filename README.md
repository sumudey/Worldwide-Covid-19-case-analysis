# Worldwide-Covid-19-case-analysis
In this Python project I used a dataset which contained the # of cases of deaths, recovery, active cases and population of various countries in the world. 
Initially there were some NA values and in the data cleaning process I replaced them with their minimum values. 
Also, for further analysis I converted the data types of various variables from 'object' to 'float'.
To create the world map plot, I used latitude and longitude of all countries given in the public forum.
